KanjiScreenSaver 2

This is a rewrite of my original Kanji ScreenSaver (still available at http;//www.japan-diary.com/TODO). The original was written (way back in 2004) in a combination of Visual Basic (the old pre-dotNet Visual Basic) and Visual C++ and used kanji data from Jim Breen's KanjiDic project.
The new version has been rewritten in C# and uses kanji data compiled by myself.

Major Changes

On-readings and Kun-readings have been replaced by a list of keywords that demonstrate real-life examples of each reading of a kanji.
The grades have been changed to match the Kanji Kentei Exam levels ( refer http://www.kanken.or.jp/ ).
It is now possible to fine tune which kanjis are displayed via an "Include" list and an "Exclude" list.
The elapsed time been kanji changes is now configurable.
